# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing React chat application from a mock data system to a fully functional Telegram-like messaging app integrated with real backend APIs. The app will support user authentication, real-time messaging via WebSocket, chat management, and message sending/receiving capabilities while maintaining the existing premium UI/UX design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my personal chat conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials (identifier and password) THEN the system SHALL authenticate via `/api/v1/pub/login` endpoint
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the session token securely
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user has a valid stored token THEN the system SHALL automatically log them in on app refresh
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the stored session token and redirect to login

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see my chat list so that I can navigate between different conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL fetch and display DM chats via `/api/v1/chats/get-dm-chats`
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL fetch and display group chats via `/api/v1/chats/get-groups`
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL fetch and display channels via `/api/v1/chats/get-channels`
4. WHEN chat data is loaded THEN the system SHALL display chat names, avatars, and last message previews
5. WHEN a user clicks on a chat THEN the system SHALL select that chat and load its messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my profile information so that I can verify my identity and account details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL fetch user profile via `/api/v1/user-me/get`
2. WHEN user profile is loaded THEN the system SHALL display user avatar, username, and relevant info in the sidebar
3. WHEN user profile fails to load THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive messages in real-time so that I can have live conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL establish WebSocket connection to `ws://[domain]/api/v1/ws`
2. WHEN WebSocket connects THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Bearer token in headers
3. WHEN a new message is received via WebSocket THEN the system SHALL add it to the appropriate chat
4. WHEN a `join_chat` event is received THEN the system SHALL update chat membership status
5. WHEN WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to my contacts so that I can communicate with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message and presses send THEN the system SHALL send the message via `/api/v1/msgs/send-message`
2. WHEN a message is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL add it to the current chat messages
3. WHEN message sending fails THEN the system SHALL display error feedback and allow retry
4. WHEN a user selects a chat THEN the system SHALL enable the message input for that chat
5. WHEN no chat is selected THEN the system SHALL disable message input

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to use environment variables for configuration so that it can work in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for HTTP API endpoints
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL use `VITE_WS_BASE_URL` for WebSocket connections
3. WHEN environment variables are not set THEN the system SHALL use appropriate default values
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL construct URLs using the configured base URLs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle loading states and errors gracefully so that I have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL indicate offline status
4. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login screen
5. WHEN WebSocket disconnects THEN the system SHALL show connection status and attempt reconnection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to maintain the existing premium UI/UX design so that I have a consistent visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating real APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing CSS styles and animations
2. WHEN displaying real data THEN the system SHALL use the same component structure and layouts
3. WHEN showing loading states THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the design system
4. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL follow the established visual patterns
5. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL preserve the glass morphism effects and smooth transitions
